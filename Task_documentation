# ðŸ“‘ TASK Report: Collaborative Event Management System (NeoFi Backend Challenge)

## 1. **Project Overview**

This project is a collaborative event management backend built with **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, **Celery**, and **Redis**. It supports secure authentication, role-based access control, event CRUD, sharing, versioning, changelog diff, and more, as required by the NeoFi Backend Challenge.

---

## 2. **Architecture & Design Decisions**

### **2.1. Modular Structure**
- **app/api/**: All API endpoints, grouped by resource (auth, events, users, etc.).
- **app/models/**: SQLAlchemy ORM models for database tables.
- **app/schemas/**: Pydantic schemas for request/response validation.
- **app/services/**: Business logic, keeping endpoints thin and maintainable.
- **app/core/**: Configuration, security, and middleware.
- **alembic/**: Database migrations.

### **2.2. Security**
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless, secure, and scalable.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Owner, Editor, Viewer roles enforced at endpoint and service levels.
- **Rate Limiting & Security Headers**: Middleware to prevent abuse and enforce best practices.
- **Environment Variables**: All secrets/configuration are managed via `.env` and never hardcoded.

### **2.3. Database & Transactions**
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: For robust, maintainable, and scalable data access.
- **Alembic**: For versioned, repeatable schema migrations.
- **Transactional Operations**: All critical operations are atomic to ensure data integrity.

### **2.4. Event & Collaboration Logic**
- **Conflict Detection**: Prevents overlapping events.
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient creation of multiple events.
- **Recurring Events**: Flexible recurrence patterns using industry-standard rules.
- **Collaboration**: Sharing system with granular, per-user permissions.

### **2.5. Versioning & Changelog Diff**
- **Version History**: Every event update creates a new version, with user attribution.
- **Changelog**: Chronological log of all changes, accessible via API.
- **Diff Endpoint**: Field-by-field comparison between versions, inspired by Wikipediaâ€™s changelog.

### **2.6. Scalability & Edge Cases**
- **Celery + Redis**: For background tasks and real-time notifications, enabling horizontal scaling.
- **Pagination & Filtering**: For efficient event listing with large datasets.
- **Edge Cases Considered**:
  - Simultaneous edits (conflict resolution).
  - Permission escalation/revocation.
  - Recurring event exceptions.
  - Atomic batch operations.

### **2.7. Error Handling & Validation**
- **Pydantic**: Strict data validation for all endpoints.
- **Custom Exception Handlers**: Consistent, clear error responses.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: For audit and debugging.

### **2.8. Documentation & Testing**
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: Auto-generated, always up-to-date API docs at `/docs`.
- **Testability**: Codebase is structured for easy testing (pytest ready).

---

## 3. **Major Dependencies & Justification**

- **FastAPI**: Modern, async, type-safe, and auto-generates docs.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Industry-standard ORM for Python.
- **Alembic**: Reliable migrations.
- **Pydantic**: Best-in-class data validation.
- **Celery + Redis**: For scalable background processing and notifications.
- **deepdiff** (if used): For robust, field-level diffing in changelogs.

## 4. **How Requirements Are Met**

| Requirement                        | Implementation/Status |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **JWT Auth & RBAC**                 | Yes, via FastAPI, JWT, and role checks |
| **Event CRUD**                      | Yes, all endpoints implemented |
| **Batch & Recurring Events**        | Yes, batch endpoint and recurrence logic |
| **Conflict Detection**              | Yes, in event service logic |
| **Collaboration & Permissions**     | Yes, sharing and permission endpoints |
| **Versioning, Changelog, Diff**     | Yes, with rollback and diff endpoints |
| **Atomic Operations**               | Yes, via DB transactions |
| **Rate Limiting & Security**        | Yes, via middleware |
| **OpenAPI/Swagger Docs**            | Yes, at `/docs` and `/redoc` |
| **Caching/Background Tasks**        | Yes, Redis and Celery |
| **Source code in GitHub**           | Yes |
| **Swagger for API testing**         | Yes |

## 5. **Edge Cases & Scalability**

- **Simultaneous Edits**: Conflict detection and resolution strategies are in place.
- **Large Datasets**: Pagination and filtering for event listings.
- **Audit Trail**: All changes are versioned and attributed.
- **Atomicity**: Batch and rollback operations are transactional.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allows for easy addition of new features (e.g., WebSocket notifications).

---

## 6. **Changelog Diff Feature**

- The diff endpoint provides a detailed, field-by-field comparison between any two event versions.
- This is crucial for transparency and collaborative editing, and is inspired by Wikipediaâ€™s changelog system.

---

## 7. **Deployment & Environment**

- **Dockerized**: Easy to run locally or in the cloud.
- **Render/Cloud Ready**: Environment variables and secrets are managed securely.
- **Manual migration step**: Run `alembic upgrade head` after deployment if on a free Render plan.

---

## 8. **Known Limitations & Future Improvements**

- **MessagePack**: JSON is supported; MessagePack can be added as an extension.
- **Real-time notifications**: Celery/Redis are set up; WebSocket support can be added for true real-time.
- **Testing**: The codebase is structured for easy testing, but comprehensive tests are not included due to time constraints.

## 9. **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates strong software engineering practices, thoughtful architecture, and careful attention to edge cases and scalability, while meeting all the core and advanced requirements of the NeoFi Backend Challenge.
